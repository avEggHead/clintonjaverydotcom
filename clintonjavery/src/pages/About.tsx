        Hey, Iâ€™m Clinton Avery. This is my place to share my work, thoughts, and interests.
        I'm a husband, father, and software engineer.  I live in rural North Carolina on a homestead with
        my wife and kids, and a few chickens.  When I'm not programming computers for work, I'm reading books, 
        lifting weights, trying to play the piano, or helping my wife with the homestead.
      </p>
